    "## Introduction\n",
    "In modern medicine, organ transplants are frequently done in order to replace a patients failing or failed organs. Often, doctors are able to identify issues of bodily failure early on and schedule a date and time for an organ transplant operation. Under these circumstances, transportation of the organ via truck or helicopter, is suitable as the patient has time before their organ fails or ruptures. In more time sensitive cases, like trauma or late identification of organ failure, more emergency measures are needed. In these certain scenarios, a patient may need an organ within 24 hours and the only availability is greater than 500 miles away. Based on this necessary service and opening in the market, the hospital network Geisinger Permanente has decided to open up a subsidiery business called TransOrgo. TransOrgo will use airplanes to transport organs in time-dependent situations when the distance to the next available organ is greater than 500 miles away and the organ is needed within 12-24 hours. The owners of TransOrgo has assessed market conditions and deemed it to be a profitable business. Before purchasing any airplanes, the stakeholders of TransOrgo are asking for the data science team to conduct an analysis of incident data and determine the lowest risk airplanes to purchase. \n",

Before we proceed with our calculation, we will first remove all engines from our data set that aren't Turbo Fan, as that is the type of engine we decided on and will enhance our analysis of the proper number of engines to use.

    "To show how we reached this conclusion, we run the same proportional analysis as above, by grouping the data by the \"Number.of.Engines\" column, finding the summation of each value in \"Number.of.Engines\" in which the \"Injury.Severity\" column is equal to \"Serious\" or starts with the word \"Fatal\", and setting it equal to a variable enginecount_incident_data. Then we set another variable called enginecount_total_incidents equal to the total number of counts of each value in \"Number.of.Engines\". Then we find the percentage of each number of engines in which the incident involving an Turbo Fan airplane with that amount of engines was a Serious or Fatal incident and print the answer. "

    "As the results show, single-engine turbo fan airplanes are an outlier and incidents involving them were Serious or Fatal 41.67% of the time. Turbo Fan airplanes with two, three, and four engines were relaivley close to each other in terms of risk, coming in at 7.02%, 4.65%, and 7.50% respectivley. Although three-engine aircraft show the lowest severity rate at 4.65%, it's important to note that the difference in severity rate between the three-engine aircraft (4.65%) and both the two-engine (7.02%) and four-engine (7.50%) aircraft is relativley small. Moreover, all engines exibit significantly lower severity rates than single-engine aircraft (41.67%). Considering the statistical closeness of severity rates between two, three, and four-engine aircrafts, it is prudent to recommend multi-engine turbo fan airplanes for enhanced safety. "
